//		 the word with the least number of vowels - if there are two or more
//		 words with the same number of vowels, it should return the shortest word.
//		 You may find it helpful to write a helper method called countVowels that 			 
//		 uses an accumulator algorithm to count the vowels.

//		 EX : String[] arr = {"hey","yolo","hi","this is long"};
//		 System.out.println(minVowels(arr));
//		 should print "hi"
